Idea 
Earthquake warning system for homes It is a small device that can be mounted on walls and has a radio receiver embedded in it. It will receive seismographic information from cloud and make warning sound in case of earthquake is about to come. It will have dual speaker setup,higher pitch sounds for air and lower pitch sounds for travelling through walls so that people in neighboring rooms get alert.The device would be operated on 2 AA batteries keeping it functional in case of power failure.The radio transmission helps to get data as the internet or telephone networks can easily be overloaded during emergency situations. The device would make comforting sounds with glowing white LED in case of low magnitude earthquake.This will avoid panic in case of non destructive earthquakes It will make loud warning sound with red led glowing in case of destructive earthquake

the data for earthquakes can be obtained from here https://ds.iris.edu/ds/nodes/dmc/data/ and its web services combined with azure could solve the problem!!

It is like a companion that seemlessly blends in the home providing you with information , guidance and reassurance thus enhancing your sense of security!!
